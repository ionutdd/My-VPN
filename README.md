In partnership with the Kernel Killers team, consisting of Mihai, Denis, Fabian, and myself, we successfully developed a dedicated VPN (Virtual Private Network) within the condensed timeframe of a 24-hour hackathon. <br />
This innovative solution facilitated the expeditious alteration of our IP location to Paris. <br /> For a detailed presentation, including a video showcasing our website, please refer to the 5th slide by following this link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF2e4RVK-g/wff41uZ7yQaHkWAsYZSdcg/view
